## Topl DAML Demos

This repository contains some projects that illustrate how to implement a DAML app integrated with the Topl blockchain. All applications use the [daml-bifrost-module](https://github.com/Topl/daml-bifrost-module).

The projects are:

- java-daml-lattice-app
- js-daml-pollnft-app

### java-daml-lattice-app

This project is a Spring Boot application written in Java that implements a very simple asset tracking app backed by the Topl blockchain.

### js-daml-pollnft-app

This is a simple application that integrates DAML, the Ribn wallet, and the Topl blockchain node (Bifrost).
